# RPL-Hermes-Arduino-Code
## Arduino Code for the Hermes Flight Computer
Code still needs to be finished and tested before moving hardware out of the breadboard. Consists of multiple sensors connected to an Arduino Mega. 

BMP 280: Measures temperature, pressure, and altitude - Mostly Finished with code, output format could be changed. 

MPU 6050: Measures acceleration and rotation - Mostly Finished with code, output format could be changed.

Adafruit Breakout GPS: Tracks location coordinates - Works with example code, but still needs to be tested with ours.

MicroSD Card Reader: Saves data recorded onto a microSD card - Needs Debugging.

Xbee Transistors: Allows data recorded to be transmitted via radio transmission - Need to determine how it will work and how the sender and recipient Arduino (Ground Station) will communicate with each other.
