# RPL-Hermes-Arduino-Code
## Arduino Code for the Hermes Flight Computer
Code still needs to be finished and tested before moving hardware out of the breadboard.

BMP 280 - Mostly Finished with code, output format could be changed. 

MPU 6050 - Mostly Finished with code, output format could be changed.

Adafruit Breakout GPS - Works with example code, but still needs to be tested with ours.

MicroSD Card Reader - Needs Debugging.

Xbee Transistors - Need to determine how it will work and how the sender and recipient Arduino (Ground Station) will communicate with each other.
